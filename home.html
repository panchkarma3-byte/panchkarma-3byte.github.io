        <h2>About Panchakarma</h2>
        <p>Panchakarma is more than just a treatment; it's a deep, rejuvenating process rooted in ancient Ayurvedic wisdom. This five-step cleansing therapy is designed to remove deep-seated toxins from the body, restoring its natural balance and vitality. By targeting the root cause of imbalances, Panchakarma helps in managing chronic diseases, boosting immunity, and promoting mental clarity. It's a holistic approach that cleanses, detoxifies, and renews your body from within, setting the foundation for long-term health and well-being.</p>
